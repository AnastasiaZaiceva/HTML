# Summary
There are 2 main things in this repo:
* sample website page used for training HTML and CSS properties
* my own website with some recepies

  ## Recepie website
  On this locally-hosted website one can find some everyday recepies. The website consists of the following pages:
  - [x] **Homepage**
  - [x] **Contact Us**
  - [x] **Recepie pages**
    * _For breakfast*_
    * _For lunch_
    * _Sauces_ (to be added in future)
    * _Beverages_ (to be added in future)
 
 > **Important ❗**: As the website was made with HTML and CSS only, the Contact Us form along with the search bar cannot be used directly, they are only used to display the real items.
